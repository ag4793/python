# what are variables?

# there are differnt types of variables
# strings are text
name = "John" # quotation marks
name2 = "Lucy"
# integers are whole numbers
num1 = "10" # no quotation marks
num2 = 20
print(int(num1) + num2)
# a plus sign between two variables its called 
#concatenation
# type casting when you convert a 
# variable from one type to another
# print(name +"and"+ name2 + "have"+ num1 + str(num2) + "apples")
# f strings allow us to insert variables into strings
# using f beofre the string
print(f"{name} and {name2} have {num1 + num2} apples")

# floats are decimal numbers
dollars = 10.99
# it can be postive or negative
print(f"{name} has {dollars} dollars")
# booleans are true or false
is_student = True
# it can be true or false
print(f"{name} is a student: {is_student}")
# lists are collections of values
# dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs
# problem set #1 
# 1. create 4 different types of variables

# 2. print them out

# 3. use f strings to format the strings
